/**
 * This package contains all the JPA repositories for the tables in the database.
 * They serve as our data access layer, so that we don't write SQL requests ourselves.
 * We will add methods later to manipulate more precisely the date, but a lot of methods are
 * already available since all the classes extend JPARepository.
